#
# deploy.sh -- red-zone (Linux) deployer for SNP_RLC_Extractor.
#
# Verifies a packed tarball (from deploy/pack.ps1), backs up the current
# install, and swaps in the new one *in place*. Everything stays under the
# install dir -- the PARENT directory is NEVER touched. No git, no network, no
# pip, no venv, no Python required: only bash + tar + sha256sum (base RHEL).
#
# Managed layout (all inside the install dir, e.g. .../Snp_analyzer/):
#   <install>/deploy.sh                     this script -- the update entry point
#   <install>/.deploy/incoming/             uploaded tarball + .sha256
#   <install>/.deploy/staging/              full extract happens here first
#   <install>/.deploy/backups/<timestamp>/  previous install (keeps last N)
#   <install>/.deploy/tmp/                  scratch (doctor.sh)
#   <install>/.deploy/preserve.list         optional: top-level names to KEEP
#                                           across deploys (your own data dirs)
#
# Usage -- upload the tarball INTO the install dir, then just run this:
#   cd .../Snp_analyzer
#   bash deploy.sh                      # auto-detects the .tar.gz sitting here
#   bash deploy/doctor.sh --test        # then check the box can actually run it
#
# With no argument it picks up the newest *.tar.gz in the install dir (and says
# which one, plus which it ignored). Pass a path explicitly to override.
#
# Uploaded *.tar.gz / *.sha256 at the top level are treated as DELIVERIES, not as
# install content: they are never backed up and never removed, so the file you
# uploaded is still there afterwards and backups stay the size of the install.
#
# Invoke via `bash` (not ./deploy.sh): the red zone's login shell is often
# tcsh/csh, and an upload channel may drop the exec bit. `bash` needs neither.
# Run it as a script -- never `source` it (it is bash, and it exits on success).
#
# Nothing is ever written outside the install dir: no /tmp, no /opt, no
# /var. Every scratch, staging and backup path lives under ./.deploy/.
#
# FIRST-TIME BOOTSTRAP (no deploy.sh on the box yet):
#   tar -xzf Snp_analyzer_<hash>.tar.gz   # yields ./Snp_analyzer/
#   # that directory IS the install; thereafter ./deploy.sh handles every update.
#
# ROLLBACK: each run backs up the previous install to .deploy/backups/<ts>/.
# To revert: delete the new contents (everything but .deploy) and
#   mv .deploy/backups/<ts>/* .  (or just re-deploy an older tarball).
